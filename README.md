V1.0 of Stock Tracker Project

This project is tracking different stocks (the Top 20 in the NASDAQ) over the course of five years. Bollinger bands have been calculated and shown in order to make potential predictions of buying/selling (not considered financial advice).

This uses the Dash, Textblob, numpy, and pandas libraries. It is an exercise in getting to use different libraries to create an interactive dashboard.

Sentiment analysis is currently bugged due to an inactive API key for Finnweb. Will fix in the near future.
